        <p className="">
          The Github Workshop organized by OpenSourceNest, Africa was a 6-days
          program focused on how to use Git and Github. The program taught the
          learner on how to manage code, collaborate and contribute like a pro.
          The program ran from September 1-6, 2025 which included a series of
          sessions led by amazing instructors. The included topics such as
          Introduction to git and github, github basics, branching and merging,
          collaboration and pull requests, advanced git and github and
          automation and best practices. At the final phase of the program, the
          participants are taught how to manage code changes, collaborate with
          others, and contribute to real-world projects using industry-standard
          workflows.
